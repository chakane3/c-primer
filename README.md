# c++ primer

c++ supports
<ul>
    <li>int - signed integer values</li>
    <li>float - 32 bit floating point values</li>
    <li>double - 64 bit double precision float value</li>
    <li>char - a one byte value</li>
    <li>void - represents nothing when used as a return type </li>
</ul>

## GCC and File Extensions
Heres all the file extensions we could use
| Extension | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| .h | C header file (not compiled or linked) |
| .c | C source code that is pre processed |
| .i | C source code which isnt preprocessed |
| .cpp | C++ source code that is preprocessed |

## Compiliers
The compilier translates high level code into low level code. It can set up memory called, a stack frame. It will give u some erros should it come across one (mainly syntax). The ourput of a compilier is object code. 

The compilier also provides a <b>linker</b> that links object files into an executable.

## Running on macos (VScode)
Terminal:
```c++
make foo
```

Or we could use:
```c++
g++ -o foo foo.cpp
// or gcc?
```
Then we would run ./foo to see output

The difference between make and gcc is that gcc is a compilier to help us build programs. 
Make is a build tool that invokes a compilier in a particular sequence to compile multiple sources and link them together. 

**note when adding parameters use ./foo param1 param2 param3 after running gcc/make

## makefiles
This is a text file containing the targets, dependencies, and rules for building the targets in the project. Its invoked through the "make" tool. 
Generally its a series of rules that looks like this:

```
targets : dependencies  commands

```

The targets are 1 or more files that depend on the dependents (can be a bunch of files). Therefore if one or more of the dependents are newer than one or more of the targets, then the targets need to be built again, which is done by running commands. 





## Pointer/reference data types
C++ provides 2 data types that give access to an item of data. 
<b>*</b> is used to specify a pointer data type. This defines a data type that is the <b>address</b> of an item of a specified data type. 
For example, <b>int *</b> specifies a data type that is the address of an integer<br></br>
<b>&</b> is a reference type which is used to create a new name or alias for a data item. For example, <b>float &</b> specifies an object that references a float item. 


## Passing Parameters between command line and executable
In our main function we may see this:

```c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // code ...
}

```

argc is an integer that tells us how many parameters were passed into the application. argv is an array of pointers to C strings in memory.
