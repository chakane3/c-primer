# Hello World
This is a simple hello world program in C++

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
int main() 
{
    using namespace std;
    cout << "Hello, World" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The first thing we see is that we included stdio.g and iostream.
stdio.h is our standard input and output header file.
